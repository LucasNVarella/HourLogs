# HourLogs
This project is in its final stages, yet still in development.
Documentation is under way, but focus is on features that have yet to be fixed/implemented.

This project originally began as a project with my hometown's library. Kids from the NHS (National Honor Society) would volunteer daily for the library, and the staff could not keep track of them (The NHS is a High School organization - they have a required amount of volunteer hours for membership). A member of NHS myself, I never liked to volunteer just to "get hours." So I decided to *actually* volunteer to help the library. It was then that this project was born.

Thus, the original android app was named "WPL Hour Logs," short for "Westborough Public Library Hour Logs." The title of the java app's MainWindow is also "WPL Hour Logs" (update coming in the future). I originally intended this project to be strictly specific to the library's needs. However, as it progressed I realized that it could easily be applied to any other libray, or just any other entity that needs to keep track of volunteers. From then, I began to implement more general features without starting the project from scratch. Still a work-in-progress. The goal for documentation is an Information and Help Guide document, along with some helpful comments in the code.
